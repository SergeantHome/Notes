On start application requests note list from server and updates local Core Date base.
To add a new note, please, tap on a plus button in a upper-right corner.
To edit a note, please, tap on any one.
To remove a note, please, swipe from the right to the left.

During editing or viewing of the note: 
To go back to the note list, please, tap on the back button. If there are any changes the app will ask to save.
To delete the opened note, please, tap on a trash bin icon in a upper-right corner. It's not possible to delete a new note.

To change an app localization, please, tap on a country flag in a upper-left corner and select new one from the list.

The app shows an activity idicator while it performs a network operation. 

Known issues:
1. Not all messages are localized;
2. Due to the server sends hard-coded responses, responses from the server are used to mock asynchronous operation.
